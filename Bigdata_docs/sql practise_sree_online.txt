2. WHERE vs. HAVING
3. GROUP BY vs. ORDER BY
4. UNION vs. UNION ALL
5. CTEs vs. Subqueries
6. Window functions
7. Rank vs. Dense Rank vs. Row Number
8. Primary Keys vs. Foreign Keys
9. CASE

2. Describe a scenario requiring a self join.
3. Rank all X by Y, partition by Z.
4. Select the top customer by X.
5. Which join returns the most and least observations (left/right, inner, full)?
6. Code Refactoring
7. How to optimize queries
8. What is the distribution of X?
